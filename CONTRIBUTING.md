Note: Due to a [limitation in textual](https://github.com/willmcgugan/textual/issues/14), Windows is not supported, but fear not, this works in [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

1. Fork the repository to get started.

2. Clone the repo and enter the `wtpython` folder.

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-name>/wtpython.git

If you add dependencies to the project, you'll have to run this command again to install the new dependencies. Make sure to pin the version in `pyproject.toml`. This software is under a MIT license, so all dependencies must respect this. There is an automated test that will block contributions that violate MIT.


6. Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).
```
pre-commit install
```

The `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file is configured to perform the following tasks on each commit:

- Validate yaml files
- Validate toml files
- Ensure a single new line on each file
- Ensure trailing white spaces are removed
- Ensure `noqa` annotations have specific codes
- Ensure your python imports are sorted consistently
- Check for errors with flake8
